## JAVA TRAINING UPSKILLING PROJECTS - ADVANCED LEVEL
This repo contains all projects undertaken during my upskilling journey in Java.

It holds advanced level concepts learnt as I journey through mastery of the Java programming language on a weekly basis.

### Layout of Concepts
Each folder holds projects under concepts learnt during the week created using [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to demonstrate understanding in concepts outlined as foundational by [Amalitech](https://amalitech.org/).
